1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

    - In server-side routing, a http request is sent to the server for a new webpage as in client-side routing, a new webpage is grabbed from the client side. Every time you request new data in server-side routing the page refreshes as in client-side it doesn't. Some pros of server-side are that it only grabs the data needed by the user and it's been the standard for a long time so most of the search engines are optimized for it. Some pros of the client side are that it's fast when requesting new data from a webpage. This is possible because all the data is downloaded in the very beginning. In the end, it depends on where you want the user to spend more of their load time. In between URL's or at initial load.
